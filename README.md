[ITALIC](https://italic.units.it/) mediated data via its [REST
API](https://italic.units.it/index.php?procedure=api).

**ITALIC** the Information System on Italian Lichens, makes available
information and resources about the lichens known to occur in Italy. It
is maintained and updated by the Research Unit of Professor Pier Luigi

of Italy by Nimis (2016), but nomenclatural and distributional data are
being continuously updated.
